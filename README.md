# Peer Observation of Observation Units

## Approach and purpose

This project will develop an approach to:
* Let observation units observe data observed by observation units. 
* To gradually accumulate the data to observation units being a DAO Store (there can be multiple DAO Stores depending on user needs).
* Do a prototype of such a system focused on three levels of observation units: (i) In-situ observation units being (ii) observed by back-end observation units, being (iii) observed by a DAO Store observation unit.

The purpose is to fetch and accumulate data observed by observation units for further use.
