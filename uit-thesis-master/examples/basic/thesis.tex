\chapter{Introduction}
\textbf{FRA CAPSTONE:}
\textit{The Arctic tundra in the far northern hemisphere is challenged by climate changes in the world today and is one of the ecosystems that are most affected by these changes[10]. The \gls{coat} is a long-term research project developed by five Fram Center\footnote{\url{http://www.framsenteret.no/english}} institutions. Their goal is to create robust observation systems which enable documentation and understanding of climate change impacts on the Arctic tundra ecosystems. COAT was in autumn 2015 granted substantial funding to establish research infrastructure which allowed them to start up a research infrastructure during 2016-2020[10].}


\Gls{wsn} is a system that consists of hundreds or thousands of low-cost micro-sensor nodes. These nodes monitor and collect physical and environmental conditions. The various activities  in the sensor nodes consume lots of energy and the battery of the sensor node is difficult to recharge in wireless scenarios and also because the sensor nodes are located at remote areas in the Arctic tundra.

%It is beneficial to make these sensors as cheap and energy-efficient as possible.

\textit{This thesis presents the architecture, design and implementation of a peer observation that can observe and accumulate data from in-situ observation units.}

\section{Motivation}
The motivation behind this project is...

\iffalse
This project will develop an approach to 
\begin{itemize}
\item Let observation units observe data observed by observation units. 
\item To gradually accumulate the data to observation units being a DAO Store (there can be multiple DAO Stores depending on user needs).
\item Do a prototype of such a system focused on three levels of observation units: (i) In-situ observation units being (ii) observed by back-end observation units, being (iii) observed by a DAO Store observation unit.
\end{itemize}
\fi

The purpose is to fetch and accumulate data observed by observation units for further use.

The observation units to be used for the prototype comprises
Observation Unit Processes executing on PCs and/or Raspberry Pi.

\section{Routing Protocols in WSNs}
Wireless sensor networks main task is to periodically collect information of the interested area and broadcast the information to a \gls{bs}. An easy approach to achieve this task is to make each sensor node transmit their data directly to the BS. But the problem  is that the BS can be far away from the sensor node and the sensor node will die due to energy consumption. LEACH, PEGASIS, TEEN and APTEEN are different hierarchical protocols that has been proposed as solutions to this problem \cite{fuzzy_rule}\cite{tree_based}.

LEACH \cite{leach} introduce a hierarchical clustering algorithm for sensor networks. It is self-organized and use randomization to distribute the energy load evenly among the sensors in the network. The sensor nodes  organize themselves into local clusters where one node is the local \gls{bs} or \gls{ch}. The \gls{ch} are not fixed to avoid nodes to drain their battery and to spread the energy usage over multiple nodes. The nodes self-elect a new \gls{ch} depending on the amount of energy left at the nodes at different time-intervals. LEACH is divided into different rounds where each round include a setup phase and a steady-state phase \cite{tree_based}. In the setup phase will each node decide whether to become a \gls{ch} or not. When a \gls{ch} is chosen, each node will select its own \gls{ch} based on the distance between the node and the \gls{ch} and join the cluster. In the steady-state phase will the \gls{ch} fuse the received data from the node members in the cluster and send it to \gls{bs}.

\iffalse
\begin{equation}
T(n) = \frac{P}{1-P\times(r \bmod \frac{1}{P})}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
T(n) = \begin{cases}\frac{P}{1-P\times(r \bmod \frac{1}{P})} & if n \in G\\0 & otherwise\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
P_{i}(t)=\min\left\{\frac{E_{i}(t)}{E_{total}(t)}k, 1\right\}
\end{equation}
\fi

%LEACH doesn't consider energy/battery when calculating the CH..  and has been a benchmark for improving algorithms such as the centralized clustering algorithm LEACH-C\cite {leach_c} and distributed clustering algorithms such as LEACH-E \cite{14} and LEACH-B \cite{15}. They concentrate on energy consumption reduction using node’s resid-ual energy and more relevant criterion \cite{dec_cb_alg}.


PEGASIS is a chain-based protocol with the idea to form a chain among the sensor nodes so each node will receive from and transmit to a close neighbor. The sensor nodes will also take turns on being the leader for transmitting data to the \gls{bs} and therefor distribute the energy load evenly among the sensor nodes. The chain can be organized by the nodes themselves using a greedy algorithm starting from some node or the \gls{bs} can compute the chain and broadcast it to all the nodes in the network \cite{pegasis}.

Fuzzy logic is also a suitable problem-sovling control system methodologi \cite{fuzzy_logic}.

\Gls{ch} were elected by the \gls{bs} in each round by calculating the change each node has to become the \gls{ch} using three fuzzy descriptors \cite{ch_fuzzy}.

\chapter{Architecture}
%Tell it clean/neat. Abstractions, functionalities

This chapter describes the architecture of the system. 

The main functionality can be divided into 3 sub-sections: a nodes lookup service, discovery of other nodes and incoming network requests. The architecture of the system is presented in \ref{fig:architecture}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{architecture.png}
\caption{Figure shows the architecture of the system.}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}


\section{Node Lookup Service} \label{sec:nodeLS}
The lookup service is responsible for storing a list of all previous discovered nodes and their address.

\section{Discovery Of Other Nodes} \label{sec:discON}
Each node can only discover nodes withing a possible range. Figure \ref{fig:broadcast_range} shows how a possible range of a node may be discovered. When a new node in the network has been discovered will meta-data about the node such as address be stored on locally on the device in the cluster.

\section{Incoming Network Requests}
A node may receive incoming requests from other nodes in the network. The request handler will handle the request based on the type of request. The types of request a node may receive are listed below.

\subsection{Connect To Neighbours}
When a node receive a list of neighbours in range, it will try to connect to the neighbours that are within the nodes range. It will only connect to the neighbour node if it receives a OK-message.

\subsubsection{Receive OK From Neighbours}
When a node receives a OK-message it will connect itself to the neighbour. The neighbour will also then have connected to the new node.

\subsection{Leader Election Request}
A node may receive a leader election request when a node has joined the cluster.

\subsubsection{Leader Election Request}
When a node receives a leader election request it will perform a leader election and forward the result to it's neigbours which will do a leader election as well.

\subsubsection{Leader Election Calculation Request}
If there is a leader in the cluster already and a new election should be proposed, a leader election calculation request is sent from the leader. Nodes receiving this request will calculate their leader election number. This is explained further in Section xx.

\subsection{Data Transmission}
\subsubsection{Notify Neighbours About Sending Data To Leader}
A node may receive a request that it should send its data to the leader. This request is forwarded to the nodes neighbour and so on.

\subsubsection{Send Data To Leader}
This request forwards a nodes data to the next node in the path to the leader.

%\section{Base Station Access}
%CH should access BS..?


\chapter{Design}
%Server, p2p, protocols..

In this chapter we will look at the design of the system and present the design of each component of the architecture. Figure XX shows how the cluster network may appear (in the system). Nodes are connected to other nearby nodes represented by arrows and together they form a cluster network.

\section{Broadcasting}
Node discover other nodes in the network, initiate a broadcast..
Broadcast is limited due to a radio range limitations where only nodes that are within this range will receive the broadcast, shown in Figure \ref{fig:broadcast_range}.

\chapter{Implementation}

The system is implemented in the open source programming language GO 1.9.3\footnote{\url{https://golang.org/}}.

%\section{Simulator}
%It is not feasible to have nodes out in the Arctic Tundra (like ZebraNet..) at such an early stage. This implementation simulates a real-life environment where nodes can 

\section{Distance To Other Nodes In The Network}

The formula \ref{eq:distance} is used to calculate the range between two points in a two-dimentional coordinate map and is used to see if a node is within a range or not.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:distance}
d = \sqrt{(X_{2} - X_{1})^{2}+(Y_{2} - Y_{1})^{2}}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{broadcast_simulation.png}
\caption{Broadcast simulation}
\label{fig:broadcast_simulation}
\end{figure}

\section{Data Transmission}
\subsection{Cluster-Head Election}
%Leader election takes time to stabilizwe because of gossiping..

\section{Data Accumulation}
%If leader election occurs at the same time that a leader is gathering data, get EOF when broadcasting.. But does not stop/exit program..

%Maps are not concurrent, need locks to prevent deadlock.. Or use a implementation of concurrent-map..

%mediated = try to bring to an agreement

The collected data is stored in a map and maps in Go are not safe for concurrent use. If a map is read from and wrote to from concurrent goroutines, the access must be compromised by a synchronization mechanism. One of the most common ways to protect maps is by using mutexes.
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,caption={Small Go program showing how mutexes are used when updating a map},language=C]
/*DBStation is data stored at leader*/
var DBStation struct {
	sync.Mutex
	BSdatamap map[uint32][]byte
}

func sendDataToLeaderHandler() {
	DBStation.Lock()
	defer DataBaseStation.Unlock()
	
	DBStation.BSdatamap[sData.FP] = receivedData
}
\end{lstlisting}



\chapter{Evaluation}
This chapter describes the experimental setup and metrics used to evaluate the implemented system.

\section{Experimental Setup}
All experiments were done on a Lenovo ThinkCenter with the following specifications:

\begin{itemize} 
\item Intel® CoreTM i5-6400T CPU @ 2.20GHz × 4
\item Intel® HD Graphics 530 (Skylake GT2)
\item 15,6 GiB memory and 503 GB disk
\item Ubuntu 17.04 64-bit with gcc V6.3.0 compiler and GO 1.9.3
\end{itemize}


\section{Experimental Design}
%How did we do the experiments?

%For hvert eksperiment bør du prøve å få fram: 
%- hva ønsker du å finne ut? 
%- hvordan måler du + hva måler du? 
%- hva gjør den delen av systemet som du måler? (leser fra disk, regner, sammenligner, koordinerer med andre osv)
%- Hva er metrikken (eks: operasjoner per sekund, minutter per oppgave osv)
%Det gjør det lettere for leseren å henge med.

\chapter{Discussion}
%Idea, arch, design, results, other solutions, "arch has scale issue"..

This chapter discusses our approach, experience, how we solved the problem and why we chose the solution we ended up with..


\section{Availability of nodes in the system?}
%When a node wants to join the cluster, should it ask the CH or should it join eitherway.. What if CH is sleeping (or busy) so that it's not reachable, or that nodes in the path to CH are sleeping (then how to contact CH?)..


\section{Cluster-head Election?}
%Eventual/weak consistency with leader election.. Gossiping with an ID to check if node receive the msg before or not.. Updating leader..

%Gossiping is an excellent way to rapidly spread information among a large number of nodes using only local information. There is no central component where information is coordinated. However, it cannot guarantee that all nodes will receive the information \cite{demers}. One of the main advantages of a gossip based algorithm is its ability to scale.

%To aviod flooding the network (too much), each msg have an ID so that a node can check if it has received the same message before.. If it as been received earlier, the node doesn't need to forward the message because it has likely forwarded the message in an earlier gossip.

\section{Data Transmission?}
%What if multiple leaders gather data? Replication of data is good, but also aqcuire more memory.. Find a tradeoff.. Can use fingerprint to identify data..

%How to gather data? Receive a GET-post from BS or someone else telling the CH to accumulate/gather data or gather data periodically? How does a BS send a GET-request to CH?? The CH could not be in range of the BS, so maybe send to a node in range and forward msg all the way to CH.. But again, what if some nodes are sleeping to save battery? The CH will then not receive the msg..
