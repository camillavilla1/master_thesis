\chapter{Introduction}
\textbf{FRA CAPSTONE:}
The Arctic tundra in the far northern hemisphere is challenged by climate changes in the world today and is one of the ecosystems that are most affected by these changes[10]. The \gls{coat} is a long-term research project developed by five Fram Center\footnote{\url{http://www.framsenteret.no/english}} institutions. Their goal is to create robust observation systems which enable documentation and understanding of climate change impacts on the Arctic tundra ecosystems. COAT was in autumn 2015 granted substantial funding to establish research infrastructure which allowed them to start up a research infrastructure during 2016-2020[10].


\Gls{wsn} is a system that consists of hundreds or thousands of low-cost micro-sensor nodes. These nodes monitor and collect physical and environmental conditions. The various activities  in the sensor nodes consume lots of energy and the battery of the sensor node is difficult to recharge in wireless scenarios and also because the sensor nodes are located at remote areas in the Arctic tundra.

%It is beneficial to make these sensors as cheap and energy-efficient as possible.

\textit{This thesis presents the architecture, design and implementation of a peer observation that can observe and accumulate data from in-situ observation units.}

\section{Motivation}
The motivation behind this project is...

\iffalse
This project will develop an approach to 
\begin{itemize}
\item Let observation units observe data observed by observation units. 
\item To gradually accumulate the data to observation units being a DAO Store (there can be multiple DAO Stores depending on user needs).
\item Do a prototype of such a system focused on three levels of observation units: (i) In-situ observation units being (ii) observed by back-end observation units, being (iii) observed by a DAO Store observation unit.
\end{itemize}
\fi

The purpose is to fetch and accumulate data observed by observation units for further use.

The observation units to be used for the prototype comprises
Observation Unit Processes executing on PCs and/or Raspberry Pi.

\chapter{Routing Techniques in WSNs?}
Som eget kapittel eller ha det under Related Work? Si noe om routing protocols som hierarchical (evt flat-based og location-based) og si noe om routing protocol operations som multipath (evt. query-based, QoS-based, coherent-based etc..)?

Har også fra WSN-bok ("Protocols and Architectures for Wireless Sensor Networks, Holger Karl, Andreas Willig) kap. 11 som heter "Routing Protocols" som sier noe om gossiping, energ-efficient unicast, broadcast/multicast, geographic routing og mobile nodes..

\subsection{Hierarchical Routing}
Hierarchical routing is a well know technique for network routing with special advantages related to scalability, efficient communication and energy-efficient routing in WSNs \cite{leach}\cite{leach_perf}.

\textit{Hierarchical routing is an efficient way to lower energy consumption within a cluster, performing data aggregation and fusion in order to decrease the number of transmitted messages to the base station.}

\subsection{Location-based Routing}
In location-based routing are the nodes addressed by means of their locations. The distance between neighboring nodes can for example be estimated on the basis of incoming signal strengths or the location of the nodes can be available by using \cite{routing_survey}.

%\section{Routing Protocols in WSNs}
Wireless sensor networks main task is to periodically collect information of the interested area and broadcast the information to a \gls{bs}. An easy approach to achieve this task is to make each sensor node transmit their data directly to the BS. But the problem  is that the BS can be far away from the sensor node and the sensor node will die due to energy consumption. LEACH, PEGASIS, TEEN and APTEEN are different hierarchical protocols that has been proposed as solutions to this problem \cite{fuzzy_rule}\cite{tree_based}.

LEACH \cite{leach} introduce a hierarchical clustering algorithm for sensor networks. It is self-organized and use randomization to distribute the energy load evenly among the sensors in the network. The sensor nodes  organize themselves into local clusters where one node is the local \gls{bs} or \gls{ch}. The \gls{ch} are not fixed to avoid nodes to drain their battery and to spread the energy usage over multiple nodes. The nodes self-elect a new \gls{ch} depending on the amount of energy left at the nodes at different time-intervals. LEACH is divided into different rounds where each round include a setup phase and a steady-state phase \cite{tree_based}. In the setup phase will each node decide whether to become a \gls{ch} or not. When a \gls{ch} is chosen, each node will select its own \gls{ch} based on the distance between the node and the \gls{ch} and join the cluster. In the steady-state phase will the \gls{ch} fuse the received data from the node members in the cluster and send it to \gls{bs}.

PEGASIS is a chain-based protocol with the idea to form a chain among the sensor nodes so each node will receive from and transmit to a close neighbor. The sensor nodes will also take turns on being the leader for transmitting data to the \gls{bs} and therefor distribute the energy load evenly among the sensor nodes. The chain can be organized by the nodes themselves using a greedy algorithm starting from some node or the \gls{bs} can compute the chain and broadcast it to all the nodes in the network \cite{pegasis}.

Fuzzy logic is also a suitable problem-sovling control system methodologi \cite{fuzzy_logic}.

\Gls{ch} were elected by the \gls{bs} in each round by calculating the change each node has to become the \gls{ch} using three fuzzy descriptors \cite{ch_fuzzy}.
